# sfhud
This is my custom HUD for TF2. It currently has most of the "in-game" screen complete (eg. health, ammo, etc).
This is my first custom HUD project so I'm learning as I go.

https://ko-fi.com/squidfysh (not required, but much appreciated).

## Installation
The folder [sfhud](https://github.com/Squidfysh/sfhud/tree/main/sfhud) contains all the required HUD files.

To install the HUD, paste the sfhud folder into your TF2 custom folder:
%steam install folder%\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\

## Priority To-Do List
